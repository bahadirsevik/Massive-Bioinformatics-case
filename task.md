Case Study: Mini-Bioinformatics Pipeline & Reporting
Scenario
"Professor Kılıç" from the Molecular Biology department has sent you a raw sequencing data
file. He mentions that the lab used a long-read sequencing technology for this run. He wants to
know the quality of the reads and see visual distributions of key metrics before proceeding with
full alignment. He is not a technical person, so he needs a clear summary of what the data looks
like.
Objective
Create a reproducible pipeline that performs Quality Control (QC) on raw long-read data,
analyzes specific read statistics, and generates a report for the Professor.
Part 1: The Pipeline
Write a pipeline using Nextflow or Snakemake. The pipeline should take a FASTQ file as input.
The pipeline must be reproducible. It should run inside a Docker container OR use a Conda
environment defined by an environment.yml file.
Process:

1. Incorporate a QC tool specifically designed for long-read sequencing data.
2. Write a custom script (e.g., Python) that calculates the following for each individual read
   in the FASTQ file:
   ○ GC content percentage
   ○ Read Length
   ○ Mean Read Quality Score
3. Save the results in a structured format (e.g., CSV/TXT).
   Part 2: Data Visualization
   Using the output from your custom script in Part 1, create a separate visualization script.
   ● Generate graphs showing the distributions for:
4. GC Content
5. Read Lengths
6. Mean Read Quality Scores
   ● Choose the plot types that best represent these distributions.
   ● Calculate and print key summary statistics (e.g., mean, median) for all three metrics.
   Part 3: Version Control
   ● Push all your code (pipeline script, analysis scripts, config files, Dockerfile/environment
   file) to a public GitHub repository.
   ● The repository must include a README.md file explaining how to run your pipeline.
   Part 4: Communication
   Write a short email draft (in the README or a separate file) addressed to "Professor Kılıç".
   ● Explain what you did in simple terms.
   ● Interpret the graphs you created (Are the read lengths as expected? Is the quality
   sufficient?).
   ● Provide a recommendation on next steps (e.g., "Should we proceed to alignment?").
